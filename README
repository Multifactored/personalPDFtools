Originally this was a set of really scuffed tools, but now it's just a utility for my personal use. Probably don't use this yourself, lol.

Requires Python3 all modules!

pip3 install pdf2image (use pip3 if need be)
pip3 install pillow
pip3 install PyPDF2

Good uses:
Editing PDFs in a rather convoluted way, using image editors.
Compressing PDFs locally without using some freeware online service for privacy reasons by abusing png compression.
Making PDFs uncopiable without any software, I guess.

How to use:
./pdfToPng.py resume.pdf 
- Outputs the *.png
./pdfToPng.py 0.png 
- Makes 0.pdf.
./pdfMerger.py 0.pdf 1.pdf
- Outputs result.pdf
